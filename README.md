# Ryde-OS
#### An OS made by Simon
#### MIT liscense <br> <br>
## How does it work?
This operating system uses the programming language (custom made) <br>
The programming languages supported are;<br>
RSL (ryde script language), OSL (origin script language), HTML<br>
<br>
RSL can work more efficiently with files, although OSL is faster,<br>
stronger, and lightweight in comparison. HTML is mainly there<br>
to add support for foreign languages, not to be useful really.<br>
